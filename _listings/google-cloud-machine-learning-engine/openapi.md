      summary: Delete Model Version
      description: |-
        Deletes a model version.

        Each model can have multiple versions deployed and in use at any given
        time. Use this method to remove a single version.

        Note: You cannot delete the version that is set as the default version
        of the model unless it is the only remaining version.

      summary: Get Model Version
      description: |-
        Gets information about a model version.

        Models can have multiple versions. You can call
        [projects.models.versions.list](/ml/reference/rest/v1/projects.models.versions/list)
        to get the same information that this method returns for all of the
        versions of a model.

  /v1/{name}/operations:
    get:
      summary: Get Operations
      description: |-
        Lists operations that match the specified filter in the request. If the
        server doesn't support this method, it returns `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

        NOTE: the `name` binding below allows API services to override the binding
        to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/*/operations`.

  /v1/{name}:cancel:
    post:
      summary: Cancel Operation
      description: |-
        Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation.  The server
        makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not
        guaranteed.  If the server doesn't support this method, it returns
        `google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED`.  Clients can use
        Operations.GetOperation or
        other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the
        operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation,
        the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with
        an Operation.error value with a google.rpc.Status.code of 1,
        corresponding to `Code.CANCELLED`.

  /v1/{name}:setDefault:
    post:
      summary: Set Default Version
      description: |-
        Designates a version to be the default for the model.

        The default version is used for prediction requests made against the model
        that don't specify a version.

        The first version to be created for a model is automatically set as the
        default. You must make any subsequent changes to the default version
        setting manually using this method.

      description: |-
        Creates a model which will later contain one or more versions.

        You must add at least one version before you can request predictions from
        the model. Add versions by calling
        [projects.models.versions.create](/ml/reference/rest/v1/projects.models.versions/create).

  /v1/{parent}/versions:

      summary: Get Version
      description: |-
        Gets basic information about all the versions of a model.

        If you expect that a model has a lot of versions, or if you need to handle
        only a limited number of results at a time, you can request that the list
        be retrieved in batches (called pages):

      - Version
    post:
      summary: Create Version
      description: |-
        Creates a new version of a model from a trained TensorFlow model.

        If the version created in the cloud by this call is the first deployed
        version of the specified model, it will be made the default version of the
        model. When you add a version to a model that already has one or more
        versions, the default version does not automatically change. If you want a
        new version to be the default, you must call
        [projects.models.versions.setDefault](/ml/reference/rest/v1/projects.models.versions/setDefault).
